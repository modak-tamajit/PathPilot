# 🧭 PathPilot — Psychology-Driven Offline Career Guidance App

> Swift Student Challenge Submission  
> Built entirely with SwiftUI · Fully Offline 

---

## 📌 Overview

**PathPilot** is a fully offline, psychology-based career guidance app designed to help students discover their ideal academic and professional paths.

The experience is structured into three intelligent phases:

1. **Input Phase** – Collects student name & subject preferences  
2. **Psychology Quiz** – 6 weighted MCQs build a personality profile  
3. **Results Engine** – Generates personalized career matches with roadmaps, salary ranges, and college guidance  

No APIs. No tracking. No internet dependency.  
All logic runs locally using Swift models and a custom scoring engine.

## 🏗 Architecture

PathPilot follows a lightweight **MVVM-inspired architecture** using a shared observable session model.

### Core Pattern

- `@StateObject` → Creates the single `AppSession`
- `@ObservedObject` → Injected into child views
- `AppScreen` enum → Controls navigation
- Static data models → Stored in `Data.swift`

### Why This Approach?

- Clean separation of responsibility  
- Reactive UI updates  
- Predictable state management  
- Playground-safe navigation control

## 🧠 Psychology & Scoring Engine

The intelligence of PathPilot lies in its **weighted trait matching system**.

### Step 1 — Personality Building

Each quiz answer contributes weighted points to 6 traits:

- 🔍 Analytical  
- 🎨 Creative  
- 🤝 Social  
- 🚀 Leadership  
- 🔧 Practical  
- 🔬 Research-Oriented  

Scores accumulate across 6 questions to form a personality distribution.

---

### Step 2 — Career Matching

Each career has a **unique trait weight fingerprint**.

Example:

- **Software Engineer**
  - High weight: Analytical, Practical
  - Low weight: Social

- **Psychologist**
  - High weight: Social, Research
  - Low weight: Practical

### Scoring Formula

Career Score =
(Subject Match × 5 per subject)
+
(Normalized Personality Score × Trait Weight × 10)
+
Small Random Tie-breaker


### Why It Works

- Results genuinely change based on answers  
- No two personalities produce identical rankings  
- Subject selection strongly influences outcomes  
- Scores are normalized to prevent bias
